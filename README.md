## Key Learnings
#### 1. CSS Layout Techniques
- **Flexbox**: Used for creating flexible and responsive layouts, managing spacing, and arranging elements efficiently across different screen sizes.
<br>
- **Positioning and Spacing**: Learned to control element positioning with `margin`, `padding`, and `position` properties, achieving precise layout adjustments.
  
#### 2. CSS Animations
- **Transitions and Keyframes**: Implemented animations using `@keyframes` for complex animations and `transition` for subtle interactive effects.
<br>
- **Transformations**: Applied transformations such as scaling and rotating elements, enhancing user experience and visual appeal.

#### 3. Responsive Design
- **Media Queries**: Designed layouts to adapt smoothly to various screen sizes, ensuring a consistent user experience across devices.
<br>
- **Fluid Sizing**: Utilized percentages, viewport units (like `vw` and `vh`), and `max-width` to create scalable layouts.

#### 4. Writing and Organizing README Files
- Developed skills in documenting projects clearly and concisely, covering project purpose, structure, and key learnings to make code more accessible to others.
